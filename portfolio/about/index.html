				My name is Joshua Brafman. I am an animator, author and an artist. Since before I could speak I've loved animation and the stories that can be told through it, and that's what I want to do. Writing has been a huge passion of mine from an early age, and because of this I have written and published two books, <i>Death Bunny!</i> and <i>The Last Faerie Tale</i>. I have attended Rutgers-Camden University for Animation and will continue to create more throughout my life. After all, storytelling and animation are what I live for.</p>
